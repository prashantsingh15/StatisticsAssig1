    "Levels of measurement refer to the different types or levels of data that can be collected and analyzed in statistical research. There are four levels of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.\n",

    "Nominal: The nominal level of measurement is the lowest level and represents data that can be classified into categories or labeled. It does not have any numerical value or order associated with it. Examples of nominal variables include gender, race, nationality, and color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal: The ordinal level of measurement represents data that can be ranked or ordered, but the differences between values cannot be measured or compared quantitatively. Examples of ordinal variables include ranking systems such as movie ratings (e.g., 1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, etc.), customer satisfaction ratings (e.g., very satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied), and education levels (e.g., high school diploma, associate's degree, bachelor's degree, master's degree, etc.).\n",

Examples of interval variables include temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit), years (e.g., 1990, 2000, 2010, etc.), and IQ scores.\n",

If the researcher analyzed this data using measures of central tendency and dispersion designed for quantitative data, such as the mean and standard deviation, the results would be meaningless since color is a qualitative variable at the nominal level of measurement. Instead, the researcher should use measures designed for categorical data, such as the mode and frequency tables."
